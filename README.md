# 🔠 **Word2Vec for Arabic BERT Corpus**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on training a **Word2Vec model** using the **Arabic BERT Corpus** to generate high-quality **word embeddings**, improving **natural language processing (NLP)** applications for Arabic text analysis. By leveraging **Gensim**, we train a model that captures semantic relationships between words, making it valuable for **text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation**.  

## 📂 **Dataset**  
The dataset used for training is the **[Arabic BERT Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abedkhooli/arabic-bert-corpus)**, a large collection of **preprocessed Arabic text** designed for deep learning models.  

## 🚀 **Key Features**  
✔️ **Preprocess Arabic Text** – Tokenization, normalization, and stopword removal.  
✔️ **Train Word2Vec Model** – Learn vector representations for words.  
✔️ **Visualize Word Embeddings** – Explore relationships between words.  
✔️ **Optimize for NLP Tasks** – Improve Arabic text-based machine learning models.  

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- Python 🐍  
- Gensim 🧠  
- NLP Libraries (NLTK, spaCy) 📖  
- Pandas & NumPy 📊  

## 📥 **Getting Started**
